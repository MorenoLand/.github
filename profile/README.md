The main focus of this is to have a group of freelance devs focused on **preserving video games**. Our *"mission"* would be to archive, restore, and keep any classic games we find interesting alive for future generations to enjoy.

   - Ensuring long-term protection of data

### 2. **Emulating Old Titles** 🖥️  
   - Setting up and optimizing emulators
   - Helping run retro games on modern systems
   - Updating and fixing emulators when needed

### 3. **Documenting History** 📚  
   - Collecting game manuals, packaging, and artwork
   - Archiving press materials and interviews
   - Building a resource library for future generations

### 4. **Reverse Engineering** 🛠️
